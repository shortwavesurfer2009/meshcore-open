# MeshCore Open

Open-source Flutter client for MeshCore LoRa mesh networking devices.

## Overview

MeshCore Open is a cross-platform application for communicating with MeshCore LoRa mesh radios over Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), USB serial, or TCP. The app enables long-range, off-grid communication through peer-to-peer messaging, public channels, and mesh networking capabilities.

**Website:** [meshcoreopen.org](https://meshcoreopen.org/)

</a>

The [web client](https://meshcoreopen.org/install/web/) runs in Chrome (and Chromium browsers that identify as Chrome, such as Edge or Brave) and connects over USB via Web Serial. BLE and TCP are not available in the browser. Firefox and Safari do not support Web Serial.

## Install and first use

Use the [installation website](https://meshcoreopen.org/) for available downloads, Obtainium, and the web client. Building from source is covered below.

1. Use a MeshCore radio running companion firmware with the transport you intend to use.
2. Open the app, scan for BLE devices or select USB/TCP, and connect.
3. After synchronization, open a channel to broadcast or open Contacts to send a direct message. Peers need compatible radio settings; channels need the same PSK.

See the [user documentation](documentation/README.md), [connection guide](documentation/scanner-and-connection.md), and [troubleshooting](documentation/troubleshooting.md).

The matrix describes implemented functionality, not a guarantee that every feature has been tested on every device. Web device connections use Web Serial and require Chrome and a secure origin. Image inference and translation require native runtimes and are unavailable on web. Android APKs currently include only `arm64-v8a`; the minimum Android API follows the Flutter SDK used to build.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK; web deployment currently pins 3.41.2. The Dart SDK constraint is `^3.9.2` (see `pubspec.yaml`).
- Android Studio / Xcode (for mobile development)
- A MeshCore-compatible LoRa device

### Build from source

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/zjs81/meshcore-open.git
   cd meshcore-open
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Run the app**

   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

### Web (self-host)

Use a Chromium browser. Device APIs are origin-gated, so serve the build over HTTPS.

```bash
flutter build web --release
```

Then serve `build/web/` from your own host. See [install/web](https://meshcoreopen.org/install/web/) for browser support and caveats.

### Building for Release

**Android APK:**

```bash
flutter build apk --release
```

**iOS:**

```bash
flutter build ios --release
```

## BLE Protocol

### Nordic UART Service (NUS)

- **Service UUID**: `6e400001-b5a3-f393-e0a9-e50e24dcca9e`
- **RX Characteristic**: `6e400002-b5a3-f393-e0a9-e50e24dcca9e` (Write to device)
- **TX Characteristic**: `6e400003-b5a3-f393-e0a9-e50e24dcca9e` (Notify from device)

### Device Discovery

BLE scanning filters on the Nordic UART Service UUID, so devices with custom names can be found. Known name prefixes in `lib/connector/meshcore_uuids.dart` are reference values, not discovery filters.

### Message Format

Messages are transmitted as binary frames using a custom protocol optimized for LoRa transmission. See the [protocol reference](documentation/ble-protocol.md) for frame definitions.

## Configuration

### App Settings

- **Theme**: System default, light, or dark mode
- **Language**: Use one of 18 languages (English, Chinese, French, Spanish, Portuguese, German, Dutch, Polish, Swedish, Italian, Slovak, Slovenian, Bulgarian, Russian, Ukrainian, Hungarian, Japanese, Korean)
- **Notifications**: Configurable for messages, channels, and node advertisements; per-channel muting; reply, mark-as-read, and mute actions on Android notifications and watches (reply and mark-as-read in Android Auto)
- **Battery Chemistry**: Support for NMC, LiFePO4, LiPo, and LiPo HV battery types
- **Message Retry**: Automatic retry with configurable path clearing

### Device Settings

- **Radio Power**: Transmit power adjustment within the connected device’s supported range
- **Frequency**: LoRa frequency configuration
- **Bandwidth**: Channel bandwidth selection
- **Spreading Factor**: Range vs. speed trade-off
- **Flood Scope**: Region selection for channel floods

## Contributing

Read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) before starting a contribution. Discuss changes in an issue first and base PRs on `dev`.

flutter test
```

### Development Guidelines

- Follow the Flutter style guide
- Use Material 3 design components
- Write clear commit messages
- Test on the platforms affected by your change before submitting PRs

### Code Style

- Prefer `StatelessWidget` with `Consumer` for reactive UI
- Use `const` constructors where possible
- Keep functions small and focused
- Avoid premature abstractions
- Run dart format on all changes before submitting

# Notifications

## Overview

MeshCore Open provides both **system notifications** (push-style OS alerts) and **in-app unread badges** to inform users of new activity.

## Notification Types

### 1. Direct Message Notifications
- **Triggered when**: A new incoming message arrives from a Chat or Room contact
- **Title**: Contact's name
- **Body**: Message text (reactions show "Reacted [emoji]", GIFs show "Sent a GIF")
- **Priority**: High
- **Android channel**: `messages`
- **Android style**: conversation (MessagingStyle) showing the last few messages, with **Reply** and a hidden **Mark as read** action. When URL images are enabled, an image preview appears as the notification's thumbnail

### 2. Channel Message Notifications
- **Triggered when**: A new message arrives on a non-muted channel
- **Title**: Channel name (or "Channel N" if unnamed)
- **Body**: `"<senderName>: <message text>"`
- **Priority**: High
- **Android channel**: `channel_messages`
- **Android style**: group conversation with each sender shown by name, with **Reply**, **Mute channel**, and a hidden **Mark as read** action

### 3. Advertisement Notifications
- **Triggered when**: A new node is discovered on the mesh for the first time
- **Title**: "New [type] discovered" (e.g., "New Chat discovered")
- **Body**: Contact's name
- **Priority**: Default
- **Android channel**: `adverts`

### 4. Background Service Notification (Android Only)
- A persistent low-priority notification: "MeshCore running — Keeping BLE connected"
- Required by Android for foreground services to keep BLE alive in the background
- Tap to re-launch the app
- **Does not auto-start on reboot** — the user must re-open the app manually after a phone restart

### Replying from Notifications, Watches, and Android Auto (Android)

Message notifications can be answered without opening the app, from the notification shade, a paired Wear OS or Galaxy watch, or Android Auto (which reads messages aloud and takes voice replies).

- **Reply** sends through the connected radio exactly like the chat screen: same length limits, SMAZ and Cyr2Lat handling, and retries. Your reply is then added to the notification.
- **Replies over the message limit** are split at word boundaries into up to 3 messages. Longer replies are not sent; a "Reply not sent" notification asks you to open the app.
- **Mark as read** clears the unread count on the phone only. MeshCore has no read receipts, so nothing is sent over the mesh.
- **Mute channel** (phone and watch) mutes that channel, the same as the bell icon in the channel chat.
- If the radio is disconnected, the conversation is no longer on the radio, the radio reports a send error, or the app isn't running, a "Reply not sent" notification explains why. The reply is not queued. If a split reply fails partway, earlier parts may already have been sent.
- Replies are sent as typed; composer translation is not applied.

iOS notifications do not have reply actions yet.

### Android Auto

MeshCore Open works in Android Auto as a notification-based messaging app. There is no MeshCore screen in the car; Android Auto provides the interface.

- New direct and channel messages appear on the car display and can be read aloud.
- Reply by voice or with a suggested reply; replies follow the rules above (splitting, failure notifications, no translation).
- Android Auto shows **Reply** and **Mark as read**. **Mute channel** is marked as a mute action, but Android Auto only documents reply and mark-as-read for messaging apps, so mute may not appear in the car; use the phone, a watch, or the bell icon.
- Setup: none beyond allowing MeshCore Open notifications. The app must be running with the radio connected, as for any notification.

Limitations:

- Only messages that arrive during the Android Auto session are shown; there is no conversation list or message history in the car.
- You can reply to a received message, but you cannot start a new message by voice (for example, "send a MeshCore message to Public"). Android Auto does not currently offer this to third-party messaging apps.
- Sideloaded or debug builds only appear in Android Auto when its developer setting **Unknown sources** is on.

Testing with the Desktop Head Unit (DHU): enable Android Auto developer mode (tap **Version** about 10 times in Android Auto settings), turn on **Unknown sources**, choose **Start head unit server**, run `adb forward tcp:5277 tcp:5277`, then start `desktop-head-unit` from the SDK's `extras/google/auto` package. Use DHU 2.1 or newer; version 2.0 disconnects from current Android Auto releases.

### Notification Tap Behavior

Tapping a notification currently re-launches the app at the root route. It does **not** navigate directly to the relevant chat or channel.

## In-App Unread Badges

Red numeric badges appear throughout the UI:
- **Contacts list**: Each contact row shows a red pill badge (e.g., "3") for unread messages
- **Channels list**: Each channel row shows an unread badge
- **Chat screen subtitle**: Shows unread count inline
- Badges cap at "9999+" for display

### How Unread Counts Work

- Stored per contact (by public key) and per channel, **scoped to the connected device's identity** (first 10 hex characters of its public key). Switching between different radios gives each its own independent unread state
- **Suppressed when viewing**: Opening a chat resets the count to 0 and cancels the OS notification
- **Ignored for**: Outgoing messages, CLI messages, and repeater contacts
- Debounced writes (500ms) to avoid excessive storage I/O during message bursts

## Notification Settings

Access via **App Settings → Notifications**:

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Enable Notifications | On | Master toggle; requests OS permission when turned on |
| Message Notifications | On | DM alerts (greyed out if master is off) |
| Channel Message Notifications | On | Channel alerts (greyed out if master is off) |
| Advertisement Notifications | On | New node alerts (greyed out if master is off) |

### Per-Channel Muting

Mute or unmute a channel from any of these places. Muted channels do not generate OS notifications.

- The bell icon in the channel chat app bar
- Long-press a channel in the channels list → "Mute channel" / "Unmute channel"
- **Mute channel** on a channel notification (Android)

There is no per-contact muting.

## Rate Limiting

The notification system prevents notification storms:
- **Minimum interval**: 3 seconds between alerts
- **Messages**: each direct or channel message always updates its conversation notification, so Reply stays available. Messages arriving within 3 seconds of the last alert update silently instead of alerting again.
- **Advertisements batch window**: If multiple advertisement notifications arrive within 5 seconds, they are combined into a single summary notification on a fourth Android channel (`batch_summary`). The title is "MeshCore Activity" and the body lists the count (e.g., "3 new nodes"). Batch summaries are Android-only; queued notifications that overflow the batch window are silently dropped on other platforms

## Notification Clearing

- **Opening a contact chat**: Cancels the OS notification and resets unread count
- **Opening a channel**: Cancels the channel notification and resets unread count
- **Opening Contacts screen**: Cancels all advertisement notifications

## Translation and image references

Automatic incoming translation can also translate notification text when enabled with a ready local model. GIF and URL-image retrieval still need internet; receiving a notification does not make those references available offline. For image packet progress and reconstruction states, use [channel image chat](image-messages.md).
